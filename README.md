# Overview
The Campus Shuttle Management System is designed to streamline transportation within large university campuses. It provides an easy-to-use platform for students, faculty, and staff to view shuttle routes, track live shuttle locations, and book rides seamlessly. The system also supports administration by offering tools for managing schedules, tracking shuttle usage, and processing payments, all while reducing the need for manual operations.

The goal is to make shuttle transportation more efficient, reliable, and convenient for all users on campus, while minimizing operational overhead and improving environmental sustainability by reducing paper-based processes.

1. Live Shuttle Tracking: Students can view the real-time location of shuttles on campus, helping them choose the nearest shuttle and make informed decisions.
2. Shuttle Booking System: Allows students to book shuttle rides in advance and pay online, saving time and reducing wait times.
3. Administrative Dashboard: Provides the administration with a detailed view of shuttle bookings and revenue, improving overall management.
4. Paperless Record Keeping: Eliminates the need for physical records, making the system eco-friendly.
